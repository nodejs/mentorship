# Step 1: Mentor Outreach (Week 1)

## Motivation

Our first order of business in finding a new Mentee is finding a place where their help is needed. In order to ensure we are directly serving the needs of the Node.js Organization, we use a Mentor-oriented approach, as opposed to letting Mentees work on whatever they see fit. Our aim is to find an immediate and important need of the organization through interfacing with other Initiatives and Working Groups.

## Procedure

Currently our internal outreach procedure is in its initial stages and is not well-defined.

## Notes

* Initially, we used the MI itself as a case study and used the first iteration of our Process to Select and onboard a new Mentee to our Initiative. In parallel with our work on onboarding that Mentee, we approached the Community Committee and asked for leads on Initiatives that may benefit from our Program and the Community Committee identified the Examples Initiative as a good candidate Initiative for the Program.
* In the future we want to create a permanently accessible mechanism by which Initiatives can reach out to us instead of or in addition to us reaching out to them. One possible such mechanism could simply be a description of our Program and the service we provide somewhere on the nodejs.dev website, that would include a link or email address to contact us with.
