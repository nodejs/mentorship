# Step 5: Mentee Outreach (Weeks 5 & 6)

## Motivation
With a Position ready to be filled, it’s time to find suitable Applicants. We want to wait a reasonably long amount of time so that people with normal lives have time to notice one of the announcements and make time to complete the Application.

## Procedure
On the Posting Date for a Position, it will be announced in the Mentorship Channel. The Position announcement will also be broadcast in collaboration with the Node.js Social Team. Lastly, the Position will be announced via the Node.js Medium Blog. Position announcements will be accompanied by a link to the Initiative Application as well as the Expiration Date. We will wait for the duration of the Application Period. If, by the end of the Application Period, we don’t feel that there are enough Applicants, we may extend the Expiration Date. The Mentor also has the option to extend the Expiration Date. Whenever the Expiration Date is extended, the extension will be announced in the Mentorship Channel as well as by email to Subscribers.

## Notes
* Should we begin filtering applications as soon as they come in? This would allow us to decide if there were enough Candidates, as opposed to Applicants, which may be a better indicator that it is ok to stop accepting applications and begin the selection process.
